#Today I will create a tip calculator with a code that I wrote.

bill = input("What was the total bill?")
percent = input("How much tip would you like to give? 10,12 or 15")
people = input("How many people to split the bill?")

tip = (((float(bill) / int(people)) / 100) * int(percent))
tip_total = (float(bill) / int(people)) + tip
bill_round = round(tip_total,2)
print(f"Each person should pay : ${bill_round}")
